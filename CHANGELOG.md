## Version 0.1.21 (development)

Initial release to pypi with changes for better compatability with windows and
linux

The `nef test` command was disabled for this release as pytest and the tests
were not working well with the pyscaffold based release pipeline.

There were no changes in the tools and transcoders provided in this release,
as this release was mostly about removing technical debt

## Version 0.1.22 (development)

The `nef test` command is once again available.

A reliance on caching stdin was removed

There were no changes in the tools and transcoders provided in this release,
other than the test subcommand, as this release was focused on testing.

  - The project is now automatically tested on python 3.9-3.12 and Linux and MacOS as a matrix hsing GitHub Actions

- MARS and Fasta
  - Fasta output and input to NEF-Pipelines supports round tripping of chain ids [chain_codes] and chain starts via a custom header
  - Mars has a command to read in a sequence from its Fasta file [including round tripping if written by NEF-Pipelines]  [command mars import sequence]

- Simulations
  - The command `simulate peaks` replaces the command `shifts make_peaks` [mostly a rename]
  - Types of spectra are now arguments to `simulate peaks` not options and the command has better error messages and case-insensitive matching of spectra names [where possible]
  - Simulation of unlabelling spectra added [command: simulate unlabelling]
