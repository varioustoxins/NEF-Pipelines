## Version 0.1.21 (development)

Initial release to pypi with changes for better compatability with windows and
linux

The `nef test` command was disabled for this release as pytest and the tests
were not working well with the pyscaffold based release pipeline.

There were no changes in the tools and transcoders provided in this release,
as this release was mostly about removing technical debt

## Version 0.1.22 (development)

The `nef test` command is once again available.

A reliance on caching stdin was removed

There were no changes in the tools and transcoders provided in this release,
other than the test subcommand, as this release was focused on testing.

a  number of bug fixes in the sparky and echidna tools

bug fixes for talos

## version 0.1.49 - withdrawn [non functional release]

- rename can now edit frame names
- --pipe is now --in
- output to csv files is supported using tabulate
- the pdbx subcommand is now rcsb and supports mmcif
- remove use of biopython
- use new lighter weight mmcif pdb and fasta parsers

## version 0.1.50
release is the same as 0.1.49 but...
- added missing packages required for installation

## version 0.1.51
- added support for reading NMR-STAR shifts and sequences
- various bug fixes

## version 0.1.52
release is the same as 0.1.51 but...
- added missing packages required for installation
  - annotated-types
  - hjson
  - pydantic

## version 0.1.53
release is the same as 0.1.51 but...
- added missing packages required for installation
  - cache_tools

## version 0.1.54
- added support for reading NMR-STAR projects from disk or the web
  - including reading shifts and sequences
  - supports direct download from the bmrb just using an accession code

## version 0.1.55
- shifts make peaks now supports non ccpn peak lists for triple resonance spectra†

† ccpn peak lists when incompletely assigned use @xx-1 to indicate the previous residue
  and this was supported in the previous release but raw peak numbers weren't!

## version 0.1.56
- bmrb accession codes are now supported as raw numbers as well as bmrXXXXX in the nmrstar project subcommand

- improve shifty output, by default it now
  1. infills missing residues
  2. selects a single assigned chain to output if present
  3. outputs to a templated file name

## version 0.1.57
- upgrade pyparsing and pynmrstar
  1. pyparsing was triggering a deprecation warning
  2. pynmrstar had a bug in renaming frames

## version 0.1.58
- corrected a bug in Linking lookup in the nmrstar project subcommand that affected some python versions

## version 0.1.59
- corrected a bug in fasta sequence importer that affected files with spaces between residues
- improve handling of figures of merit especially for MARS peak imports
- spectrum dimension transfers were not correct in peak imports

## version 0.1.60
- add support for c detect spectra for idps in peak simulation code

## version 0.1.61
- use requests to download bmrb files from the web

## version 0.1.62
-use urllib3 <= / == 1.26.15 to avoid a security warning
