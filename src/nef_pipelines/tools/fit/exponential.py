# implementation thoughts
# 1. having a spectrometer frequency and field strength in the same construct is a pain, what do we define as the
#    conversion ratio i took value in cavanagh and cross-checked it with from https://www.kherb.io/docs/nmr_table.html
#    which uses the codata value for 1H [but not for 15N and 13C which use the IAEA values]
# 2. if we have 1H and 15N and 13C spectrometer frequencies which should we use to
#    calculate the field strength? i chose the one with the highest gamma, but note my gamma ratios do not match
#    those in https://www.kherb.io/docs/nmr_table.html exacly
# 3. do we need the value type should it be Nz for a 15N experiment, what are I and S defined as in this context
# 4. how do we determine the relaxation_atom_id shouldn't also be available on the series data or come from the series
#    data as it's the type of experiment and the experimenta series that determine this, currently choose lowest gamma!
# 5. the value doesn't have a type just a unit, should it?
# 6. the source maybe should be on the data series rather than the relaxation list -  it knoes what its is
#    the relaxation list doesn't need tow
# 7. the nef_relaxation doesn't leave room for other fit values e.g I or the baseline offset for a 3 point fit...
# 8. room for a comment on each fit would be good...
# 9. when would the index and data_id in a nef_relaxation_list be different?
# 10. we should say the value error is sigma
# 11. why are some of our constants capitalised and others not - we should be consistent
#     e.g. experimental | simulated | theoretical vs OnePhaseDecay | ExponentialDecay | InversionRecovery | other
# 12. why is relaxation_list_id repeated when nef_series_list isn't a singleton and applies to only one experimental
# series?
# 13. question can you use _nef_series_data as an input table for a calculation and leave relaxation_list_id blank to be
# filled out by the calculation engine. Also for het noe should the series list values be  bool or 1 and 0 for the
# saturation
# 14. not sure not repeating the atom names in the series data is a good idea as the _nef_relaxation loop needs
# them for the result and you have to wade through all the spectra again while dou don't need to for the actual dat and
# they can be inconsistent or even missing...
# 15. there is no connection from the nef_relaxation_list to the original nef_series_list specifically
#     it has a data_id but series list that data_id refers to isn't mentioned... to find it i have to scan
#     through all save_nef_series_lists and what happens if 2 refer to this nef_relaxation_list...
# 16 experiment_ypes homonuclear_NOEs is plural and some are singular
# 17. shouldn't it be value_uncertainty
