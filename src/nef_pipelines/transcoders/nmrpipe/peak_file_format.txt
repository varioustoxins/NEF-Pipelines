       INDEX
           the unique peak ID number. [%5d] - mandatory?

      X_AXIS ...
           the position of the peak in points, by parabolic inter-
           polation. [%9.3f] - mandatory?

      DX ...
           estimate of the error in peak position  due  to  random
           noise, in points. [%6.3f]

      X_PPM ...
           the position of the peak in PPM, by parabolic  interpo-
           lation. [%8.3f]

      X_HZ ...
           the position of the peak in Hz, by parabolic interpola-
           tion. [%9.3f]

      XW ...
           the full width at half height in points,  estimated  by
           parabolic interpolation. [%7.3f]

      XW_HZ ...
           the full width at half height in Hz, estimated by para-
           bolic interpolation. [%8.3f]

      X1/X3 ...
           coords of the bounding region surrounding the  peak  or
           its cluster in points. [%d] - mandatory?

      HEIGHT
           the peak height, estimated by parabolic interpolation. - mandatory?

      DHEIGHT
           the error peak height due to random noise, estimated by
           parabolic interpolation.

      VOL  the peak volume, estimated as the sum of intensities in
           the  neighborhood  (bounds  given  by X1/X3 etc) of the
           peak maximum.

      ASS  location to hold assignment data. - mandatory?

      PCHI2
           the chi-square probability for the peak (i.e. probabil-
           ity that the peak could be due to random noise alone).

      CLUSTID
           identifies the cluster of peaks that a given peak over-
           laps.  Peaks with the same CLUSTID value are considered
           to be in one overlapped group.

      MEMCNT
           the total number of peaks which are in a  given  peak's
           cluster (i.e. peaks which have the same CLUSTID value).

      TYPE An  integer   describing   the   peak   classification;
           currently  1  =  Peak, 2 = Random Noise, 3 = Truncation
           artifact.
